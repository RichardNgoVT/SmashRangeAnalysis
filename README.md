# SmashRangeAnalysis
This program is dependent on the output from the SmashRangeGetter program. This program is still in development, but at the moment, the uploaded build can compare two specified moves horizontally, and tell you which move will beat out the other. (https://imgur.com/a/VDcQLE0 ) 

End result aims to inform user how moves or stances (ducking, landing lag, jump squat, ledge grab) would interact with each other by comparing their hit and hurt boxes, and to identify what moves are punishable or safe on shield by comparing attacker’s move's frame data, range, fall speed, and height at which attack makes contact with the shield, against all of defender's out of shield options. Also aims to create visualizations of character’s “threat zones” inspired by Sethlon’s Roy Guide’s section on controlling space (https://smashboards.com/guides/playing-with-ph1r3-gold-version.62/), given a user’s inputted reaction time, character’s movement speed, and all attacking ranges and frame data.

(Note: Because this build of the program is outdated, it is not compatible with the current build of SmashRangeGetter. The only moveset information available in this build is Falcos)
